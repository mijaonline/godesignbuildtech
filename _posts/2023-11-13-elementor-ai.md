**Elementor AI** is natively integrated within the Editor to generate original text, code, and images. Say goodbye to time-consuming tasks and welcome a new era of streamlined workflows.

## Spotlight

### Design Unique Experiences
Generate custom CSS code to create cool effects, without writing any code yourself. For example, create a circle-shaped clip mask on an image, and when hovering over it, make the image become semi-transparent.

### Boost the Power of Your Prompts
Driven by cutting-edge AI technology, our Prompt Enhancer helps you write better prompts. It automatically adds suggested details to your written prompts to improve your generated results.

### Leverage Your Prompt History
Use the AI History Panel to access your previous prompts and generated responses, streamlining your creation process. Refer back to what you’ve done, and pick up where you left off.

### Extend Images in Any Direction
Let AI seamlessly extend your image by cleverly filling in the image borders while leaving the original image intact.

### Create Image Variations
Use any image as a reference to generate similar variations, so you can constantly update your website with fresh content.

### Change Resolution or Resize
Adjust image resolution or change its size to fit different aspect ratios that precisely match your site requirements.

### Remove Image Background
Remove image backgrounds by detecting the object in the image and replacing its background with a transparent one.

### Replace Image Background
Replace the background of an image with anything by describing the background you want instead.
