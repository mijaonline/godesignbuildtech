## HTML Section

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is the standard markup language for creating web pages. It provides the structure and content of a webpage. Understanding HTML is essential for web development.

### Creating Headings

To create headings in HTML, you can use the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags. The `<h1>` tag represents the main heading, while the `<h6>` tag represents the least important heading.

Example:

```html
<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<h2>This is a Subheading</h2>
```

### Creating Paragraphs

To create paragraphs in HTML, you can use the `<p>` tag. It represents a block of text.

Example:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

### Creating Links

To create links in HTML, you can use the `<a>` tag. It allows you to link to other web pages or resources.

Example:

```html
<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>
```

### Creating Lists

To create lists in HTML, you can use the `<ul>` (unordered list) and `<ol>` (ordered list) tags. The `<li>` tag represents each list item.

Example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ol>
```

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is used to style web pages. It allows you to control the appearance of HTML elements.
